Owed News is a simple easy-to-use news bookmarking app. This app tackles the problem of opening an excessive amount tabs for articles that you intend on reading by allowing you to save and store the news that you're interested in reading in one collective place.  

In Owed News, a user can register and login. As an authenticated user, one can visit the article store, browse through news stories, and add them to their personal profile to be read at a future time. These news stories are stored and persisted in their profile, and should they not see fit for it anymore, they can delete the article from their profile.

This is Owed News.
